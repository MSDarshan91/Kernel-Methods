The main.m file contains all the code required to run all the functions.
In the file change the variable KernelFunction to train the SVM model with other kernels.
The accuracy plots and the contour separation plots are also included.

One noticeable thing in the accuracy plots is that, as the value of the c increases the testing set accuracy decreases.
This is because the curve is being over fitted.
